"store_listing_long" = "Dentacare, the app that rewards users for establishing healthy dental care habits, is here! Yes, you read it right. By maintaining proper dental care and adhering to all recommendations within the app, users receive incentives in the form of Dentacoin tokens (the first cryptocurrency for the global dental industry). Note: At the moment the app accumulates relative values of Dentacoin tokens. This option will be fully functional upon the next updates.  \n\n“Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.”\n– Jim Ryun\n\nNowadays, it is proven that more than 90% of all dental problems can be prevented with regular check-ups, proper oral care and nutrition (according to the Australian Dental Association). This well-known but often neglected real-world problem is about to be counterattacked by the new mobile app of Dentacoin. \n\nThe Dentacare Mobile app aims to form long-lasting dental care habits through an intensive 3-month program in an engaging gamified environment. Through reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, users will be taught how to improve their dental hygiene and thus, form healthy habits. The app educates users how to brush, floss, rinse properly and advises them further on how to take proper care of their teeth with regular check-ups, better nutrition, etc. An emergency function implemented allows users to get advice from the dental specialists within the Dentacoin network in case of problems. The app is tremendously beneficial for children as well, as forming dental hygiene habits at a young age prevents the formation of deeper dental problems in future.\n\nThe basic initial program lasts for 3 months, as it is considered that this is the time slot needed for a certain activity to be permanently integrated into the daily routine of an individual.\n\n“Call it what you will, incentives are what get people to work harder.”\n– Nikita Khrushchev\n\nOnly after maintaining a proper routine for a 3-month period, users will be rewarded with Dentacoin tokens, which they can later use for paying for dental services, dental care products, Dentacoin Assurance, or they can store them or trade on exchange platforms against other currencies.";
